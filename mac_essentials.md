# Essentials For a New Mac

Of course these are essentials for my specific needs, but maybe they might be useful to you.

## Apps

Work in progress. See [my last list from 2010][2010apps] in the meantime, but be warned that it is very, very out of date.

### General

- [1Password][], which has become indispensable for not only password management, but for managing all sorts of sensitive information. In my experience, syncs flawlessly with a shared database file via Dropbox, iCloud, or their own service. They've recently switched to a subscription model, but it's only $2.99/mo ($36/yr) vs. their old price of $40 for the app.
- [Tweetbot][] for Twitter.

### Programming

- [BBEdit][], the essential text editor. Great jack of all trades with powerful scripting capabilities.
- [PyCharm][], for a full-blown Python IDE, which I use for Python and Django scripting.
- [Growl][] and/or [Pushover][] for custom remote notifications â€” I cant quite decide which I like better. Best paired with [Prowl][] or [Pushover for iOS][]. They both have Python clients: [gntp][] and [python-pushover][], so they can also work for sending message from a server.
- [Github Desktop] for remote repositories of my code.

## Fonts

- [DejaVu Sans Mono][dejavu] as a wider-glyph replacement for [Panic Sans][coda]. I set the editor font for both BBEdit and PyCharm to this.
    - [A copy of the DejaVu fonts][dejavufonts] are included in this repository under [their free license][dejavulicense].

## VPN

Secure communications, especially when using public WiFi. I use [ProtonVPN](https://account.protonvpn.com/downloads).
